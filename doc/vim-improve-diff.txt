INTRODUCTION					*vim-improve-diff-introduction*

*vim-improve-diff* is a plugin to improve diff feature in Vim.
It provide the following features:

Auto diffupdate (|improve_diff#auto_diffupdate()|)
When user leave an insert mode, it call |diffupdate| when the current buffer
is in diff mode.


Auto diffoff (|improve_diff#auto_diffoff()|)
When user close a diff buffer, it count the number of diff buffer in a current
tab page and call |diffoff|! when there is only a single diff buffer remains.


Improved |:DiffOrig| command
If no |:DiffOrig| command is defined, it automatically define an improved
version of |:DiffOrig| command.


You would probably interested in lambdalisue/vim-unified-diff which use
a 'histogram' algorithm to improve the quality of diff.
